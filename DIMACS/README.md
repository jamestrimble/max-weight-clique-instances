# DIMACS Instances

These instances are derived from unweighted graphs from the [Second DIMACS
Implementation Challenge](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/); see _Cliques,
Coloring, and Satisfiability: Second DIMACS Implementation Challenge, October
11-13, 1993,_ Editors: David S. Johnson and Michael A. Trick; AMS, Providence,
RI, 1996.

Weights have been added using a widely-used method: the weight of vertex
_i_ is _i_ mod 200 + 1.

Two versions of each instance are included: the standard version in the
`weighted` directory, and a version with vertices randomly shuffled in the
`weighted-randomly-permuted` directory.
