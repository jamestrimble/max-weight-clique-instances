# Research Excellence Framework Instances

These instances were generated using a program developed in summer 2016 by
David Manlove, Kyle Simpson, and Patrick Prosser.  Each vertex represents an
author, along with a set of four of that author's publications.  Two vertices
are adjacent if and only if they are associated with different authors and have
disjoint sets of papers.

The `goldilocksRefAsGraph` directory contains the "not too easy, not too hard"
instances that were used for the experiments in our paper.  The `refAsGraph`
directory contains additional instances, including some very challenging ones.

The instances were provided by Patrick Prosser.  The order of the vertices
in each instance has been randomly permuted.
